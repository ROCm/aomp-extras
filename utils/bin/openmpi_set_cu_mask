#  openmpi_set_cu_mask: Script that reads OpenMPI environment variables and
#                       builds HSA_CU_MASK accordingly then launches
#                       the MPI process. This script demonstrates how to
#                       distribute a GPU across multiple ranks of an MPI
#                       job into mutually exclusive CU sets
#
#  Limitations:
#  1 Only works with AOMP 13.0-2 or greater. This has a patched rocr/hsa
#    runtime to support the HSA_CU_MASK env variable. Get AOMP 13.0-2
#    here: https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/tag/rel_13.0-2
#  2 Only works with GPUs that have less than 64 CUs.
#
#  3 Only works with OpenMPI because OpenMPI sets certain environment variables
#  4 Only creates masks that are mutually exclusive of each other.
#    That is, the MPI processes will not share CUs.
#  5 Because of 4, this demo script only works when number of CUs is
#    divisible by number of local MPI processes.
#
#  Restrictions 3,4, & 5 are artifacts of this scripted implementation.
#  Implementation by a workload manager process launch tool may be
#  more flexible in setting HSA_CU_MASK.
#
#  Example Usage:
#  mpirun -np 4 /usr/lib/aomp/bin/openmpi_set_cu_mask <MPI_APP_BINARY> <MPI_APP_ARGS>
#  mpirun -np 6 /usr/lib/aomp/bin/openmpi_set_cu_mask
